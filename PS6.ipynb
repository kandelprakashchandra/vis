        "Happiness, or more comprehensively, subjective well-being is the ultimate aim of people. The pursuit of happiness assumes different paths--accumulation of wealth, conflicts, enhancement of social connections, socio-economic equity and justice, empowerment, and many more. Happiness has become the most sought after of the goals and yet elusive. Subjective well-being has become all the more necessary given the frenetic pace of life and the attendant stress and frustration that has robbed us of our desires for peaceful and meaningful lives.Therefore, I will make attempts to probe some of the determinants of happiness.Some of the questions that I seek answers  to are as follows:\n",

        "1. How does income inequality affect happiness?\n",
        "2. Does happiness vary by region, income group and countries? Which regions and income groups, and countries are the happiest? \n",

        "4. Do better governance indicators mean more happiness?\n",

The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” (Also known as the “Cantril Ladder”.) As with the steps of the ladder, values in the map range from 0 to 10.\"\n",

In another words, the happiness is negatively correlated with increasing income disparity, both at the macro-economic level and micro-economic level(Lous & Graafland, 2021). The level of unhappiness becomes more pronounced in countries where redistribution of wealth is virtually absent or is very weak, and \"the more income is concentrated in the hands of a few, the more likely individuals are to report lower levels of life satisfaction and more negative daily emotional experiences\" (Neve and Powdthavee, 2016).\n",

        "On avergae, North America continues to be the happiest region across the timeframe; however, the happiness seems to be in decline.. South Asia is the least happiest region as it is more mired in conflicts and political instability, especially in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The region has overtaken Sub-Saharan Africa. Middle East and North Africa's people who used to be the second-most happiest people in the world in 2005 gradaully became less happier over most of the years. By the year 2020, the region had become the third-least happiest among the global geographies primarily affected by the conflicts in the middle-east, uprisings, and increasingly dictatorial regimes such as Egypt and Syria. The happiness level is higher in Europe and Central Asia, and the index is skewed by the impressive figures for socio-economic justice and equity and the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms.\n",

Overall, happiness seems to have increased in the low-income countries from 2004. This must have been the result of the wealth redistribution policies adopted by the governments in low-income countries(Dwyer & Dunn, 2022). On average, there is no change in happiness level in the lower middle income and the upper middle income countires. Most probably, the rise in income inequality explains why there is not much variation in happiness(Oishi et. al, 2022).\n",
